Neural Go
---------

I'm in the process of making significant changes to this package,
particularly, to make it more modular, and to base it around an [actual linear
algebra library for Go](https://github.com/skelterjohn/go.matrix).

If you want the original version of this library, check out the
[v0.1 tag](https://github.com/schuyler/neural-go/tree/v0.1).
